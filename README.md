# Automated Remediation Workflow Repository for Detection Engineering and Incident Response

This repository contains tested, full functional, and production ready Python scripts which can be utilized in Detection Engineering pipelines, SOAR workflows, and case management ticket enrichment. 

## Overview

The Python scripts leverage Microsoft Graph API, SNOW Table API, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API to autoremediate threats and massively increase SOC efficency

Several worfkows including disable_Entra_account.py increase SOC efficiency by > 80%

Each script includes:
- **Robust error handeling at the input level and API level**
- **JSON, ndJSON, JSONL, and CSV input options**
- **Modular structure allowing cutomization of SOAR workflows and Detection Engineering pipelines**
